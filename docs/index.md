#Welcome to the Bezerk documentation!
This is the documentation for Bezerk, the WildBeast Websocket Manager (WSM). Bezerk is intended for use **in larger WildBeast instances only** that pass the guild limit to require sharding.

##General information
The aim of Bezerk is to allow larger WildBeast instances to more easily monitor events that happen on the shards. This can be used to monitor for potential shard crashes and so forth. For more information, you can read the [terminology reference](terminology.md) and the [introduction](intro.md).

**NOTE:** As this is more advanced technology than most of our projects, this software is mainly aimed at advanced users and will hence assume a higher level of technical competence. Which means that some details are left to your own perception ability.

##Installation
Bezerk runs on a host device of your choice. The server installation process is fairly simple, you need to install the Bezerk server and configure WildBeast to use it. See Introduction for more details.

##Discord server
We have a Discord to discuss in if you fancy, you can also get support for getting Bezerk to work there. Click below to join in.

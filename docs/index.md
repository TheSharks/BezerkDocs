#Welcome to the Bezerk documentation!
This is the documentation for Bezerk, the WildBeast Websocket Manager (WSM). Bezerk is intended for use **in larger WildBeast instances only** that pass the guild limit to require sharding.

##General information
The aim of Bezerk is to allow larger WildBeast instances to more easily monitor events that happen on the shards. This can be used to monitor for potential shard crashes and so forth. For more information, you can read the [terminology reference](terminology.md) and the [introduction](intro.md).

##Installation
Bezerk runs on a host device of your choice. The server installation process is fairly simple, you need to install the Bezerk server and configure WildBeast to use it. At the time of writing a WildBeast integration does not exist, but there is a working prototype of the server. Installation guide coming later.

##Discord server
We have a Discord to discuss in if you fancy, you can also get support for getting Bezerk to work there. Click below to join in.
